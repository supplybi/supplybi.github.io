Release 0.0.3 sees the introduction of the Monte Carlo simulation as a feature of the library. The Monte Carlo simulation 
generates normally distributed random demand, based on historic data supplied by a *.csv* file. The probable demand is 
used to decrement stock over a given period, triggering transactions for opening stock, closing stock, backlog 
and purchase order quantities. <!--more -->The aforementioned values are calculated and recalculated over each transaction.



# Running the Simulation

To begin the Monte Carlo analysis we need to analyse the orders supplied by a *.csv* file, an example of the format can be found
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinFasusi/supplychainpy/master/supplychainpy/data.csv).  In this example the 
*.csv* file contains monthly demand for 32 stock keeping units (skus). To commence the analysis we need to
use the function `analyse_orders_abcxyz_from_file`:

{% highlight python %}
from supplychainpy.model_inventory import analyse_orders_abcxyz_from_file
orders_transactions = analyse_orders_abcxyz_from_file(file_path="data.csv", z_value=Decimal(1.28), reorder_cost=Decimal(5000), file_type="csv")
{% endhighlight%}

The function name generates a list of dictionaries the transactions containing:

- reorder_quantity 
- economic_order_quantity
- sku(sku id)
- standard_deviation
- ABC_XYZ_Classification
- demand_variability
- safety_stock
- average_order
- revenue
- economic_order_variable_cost
- reorder_level

The formulas for the calculations can be found [here](http://supplychainpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/calculations.html).
The docstring for the class and functions can be found [here](http://supplychainpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest/supplychainpy.demand.html#module-supplychainpy.demand.analyse_uncertain_demand)
Most of the methods in the `UncertainDemand` class are private and so cannot be accessed once the class is instantiated. 
The constructor for 'UncertainDemand' does nost of the work.
