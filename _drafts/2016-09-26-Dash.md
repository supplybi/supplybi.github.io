The world is going bot crazy, our AI overloads are just around the corner. 
To ingratiate ourselves and be on the right side of history we almost avoided pressing a bot into our service,
but we couldn't resist. Zero1, HAL, Skynet don't judge us... C'mon everyone else is doing it.

Meet Dash (data, analysis, service, handler... just kidding it is an abbreviation of dashboard) our reporting bot.
Okay "Bot" is a bit of a stretch, it's not aiming to be a full on Bot. Dash does not have an opinion on your colleagues, the football league or the latest Netflix Original.
Dash can however use natural language to provide insights into the data analysis and serve up hyperlinks as answers to queries. 
Below is a Gif of Dash in action:




Dash is very much in the early stages of development. Dash doesn't know military strategy or who Sarah Conor is however, Dash can tell you which SKUs are overstocked; so there's that.
