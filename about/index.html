            The library is currently in the early stages of development and is not
            suitable for production, the api can and will change. Opening the development to the
            community at an early stage, will generate discussion on the direction, increase bug detection and
            promote faster iterations towards a beta release.

        <h1>What is supplychainpy?</h1>
        <p>Supplychainpy is a python library for common supply chain data analysis tasks. The library aims to reduce
            the work required for supply chain analysis and expand the tools available to analysts.</p>

        <h1>Why is supplychainpy useful?</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>A Common Tool. </strong> Several types of supply chain analysis require many
                calculations and often a spreadsheet. Domains such as Finance, Econometrics and Statistics
                already have libraries across several programming languages. In fact statics libraries like
                <a href="http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/">pystatmodel</a> can be used for supply chain analysis
                fundamentals like forecasting etc. Supplychainpy is more focused on being a decision support tool
                for analysts in commercial inventory and demand planning roles. The library focuses on domain
                specific implementation issues.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>More tools</strong> Using an object orientated programming language like python
                exposes your data and analysis to cutting edge tools outside the remit of a spreadsheet.
                Tools like Pandas and Jupyter as well as other libraries. Supplychainpy allows you to include these
                optional dependencies in your work flow, lowering the bar to entry by providing a supply chain specific
                library
                with api.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Scalability. </strong> use a .txt or .csv source or data direct from a database using a
                dapi or orm like <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/"> sqlalchemy</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quicker Development. </strong> Writing and rewriting formulas can
                become a repetitive task and may include manual steps, when moving from project to project or
                organisation to organisation. A comprhensive library of common supply chain computations prepackaged
                in a library for an accessible programming language, could greatly speed up analysis
                and free up the analyst for more decision making instead of tool making.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fast Implementation. </strong> while spreadsheets excel at calculations, data intensive
                computations are difficult without using a programming language. Although VBA is provided by default
                in Microsoft Excel, it is not a panacea for these type of tasks, better alternatives exist. Python
                with the assistance of <a href=https://pypi.python.org/pypi/openpyxl"">openpyxl </a> or
                <a href="http://xlwings.org/">xlwings</a> can add the power of python to your spreadsheet
                computations. The supplychainpy library is written with optimised code using python,
                cython, c/c++ and cuda where necessary to speedup implementation. see the profiling
                section for details.
